With respect to my dad and for her robo girl, actually this is video i have uploaded because of half done GitBot software you can access git through it and soon,
I will upload its application and my next project will be the machine learning tool like DeepLearningKit or Shogun or Keras.io actually it will be the UI based 
software in which we can perform machine learning operations supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement techniques regression, k-means and importing csv and xls files
like we do with the help of pandas & plotting you can choose by options like bar, hist, scatter etc the whole [Machine Learning] product.
